# Training CelebA models

This directory consists of two jupyter notebooks that shows training models on a subset of celebA dataset. Download the dataset from https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html. 

We pick the following mutually exclusive facial attributes: black hair, blond hair, gray hair, wearing hat. Before training the models, you need to create to create a balanced set of images for each of those class, so that the model does not overfit to one specific class.
