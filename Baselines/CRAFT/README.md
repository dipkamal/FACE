We adapt the implementation of CRAFT available at the following link: https://github.com/deel-ai/Craft/tree/main

Authors of the code: 
- Thomas Fel
- Agustin Picard
- Louis BÃ©thune
- Thibaut Boissin

Please read the paper "CRAFT: Concept Recursive Activation FacTorization for Explainability" for more details on CRAFT.

We wrap the craft class with our evaluation metrics and evaluate the concept explanations extracted from CRAFT using metrics of reconstruction quality and faithfulness-complexity, discussed in our paper.
